# July-4th-Countdown-Clock
This is a countdown clock page for the Tulsa Summer Party held on July 4th of every year. 
The page shows the current date and time and to include a timer that counts down to the start of the fireworks at 9 p.m. on the 4th. 
Technologies I used in this project are: HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript. 
A preview of the completed website for a sample date and time is shown: https://abdifatahali.github.io/JavaScript-Project1/
